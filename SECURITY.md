# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FTSnext team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge and address vulnerabilities
promptly.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
[**GitHub Security Advisory
**](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/fts-next/security/advisories)
This ensures that vulnerability information remains confidential while we address the issue.

*We strive to address security vulnerabilities within 30 days of confirmation.*

## Supported Versions

We currently support the following versions:

| Version                                 | Supported |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Current minor release                   | ✅         |
| Previous minor release (up to 6 months) | ✅         |
| Older versions                          | ❌         |

We provide support for minor releases for approximately six months. We strongly encourage all users
to upgrade to the latest version to ensure issues are addressed.

**Upon discovery of severe security or usability bugs of a released version, we will mark affected
releases as pre-release and add notes to indicate why the version should not be used.**
