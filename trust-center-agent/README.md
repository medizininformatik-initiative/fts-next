# Trust Center Agent (TCA)

The TCA serves as a critical component responsible for managing trust and security aspects during
the data transfer process. It plays a central role in pseudonymization and deidentification,
coordinating with external services such as gPAS and gics, and ensuring the secure exchange of
pseudonyms between the Clinical Domain Agent (CDA) and Research Domain Agent (RDA).
